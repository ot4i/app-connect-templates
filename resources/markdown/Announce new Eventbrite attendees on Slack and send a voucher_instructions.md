## Prerequisites

To use this flow, you'll need to set up an event in Eventbrite. The event needs to be configured to collect the following information about new attendees:
* First name
* Last name
* Company
* Email address
* How they are going to get to the event

To gather the information about how attendees are going to get to your event, you'll need to [create a custom question for attendees](https://www.eventbrite.com/support/articles/en_US/How_To/how-to-create-custom-questions-for-attendees) in Eventbrite. Create the following question:
* How will you be travelling to the festival?

Set the question type to 'Radio Buttons' with the following options for the answer:
* Walking
* Cycling
* Public Transport
* Driving

Set the question as a required field for your event.
