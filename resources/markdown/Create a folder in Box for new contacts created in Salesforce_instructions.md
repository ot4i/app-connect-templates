Use this template to create a folder in Box for new contacts created in Salesforce. In this example, if the Box folder ID is not empty, a Gmail message gets sent to indicate that the folder already exists. Otherwise, a new folder is created in Box. A Gmail message is sent to the receiver, informing them that a folder for the event has been created and they can start collaborating with the event contents.
