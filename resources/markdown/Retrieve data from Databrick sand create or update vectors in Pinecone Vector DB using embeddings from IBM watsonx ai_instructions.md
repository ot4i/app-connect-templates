Use this template to retrieve student record informations from a table in Databricks . Use this to create embeddings using IBM watsonx ai of the information which include name, marks and remarks of each student.These embeddings are used to create or update vector in Pinecone DB.An existing template flow , `RAG pattern flow - Query the Pinecone Vector DB using embeddings from IBM watsonx ai and generate text with the results` can be used to test the above flow.
