Use this template to create a scheduler-based flow that retrieves CSV-type file metadata from Box for a specified time. For each Box file, the file content is retrieved in text format, and the content is appended into a Microsoft Azure Blob storage container. This scenario helps to merge multiple CSV files into a Microsoft Azure Blob storage container.
