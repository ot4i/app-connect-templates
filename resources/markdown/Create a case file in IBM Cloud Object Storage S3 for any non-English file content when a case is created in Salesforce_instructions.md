Use this template to create a case file in IBM Cloud Object Storage S3 for non-English file content whenever a new case is created in Salesforce.Â When a new case is created in Salefroce, the file is created in Box. If the file content is non-English, the case file will be created in IBM Cloud Object Storage S3. Otherwise, a Slack message gets sent to the intended channel, notifying that the file for the case ID already exists in English.
