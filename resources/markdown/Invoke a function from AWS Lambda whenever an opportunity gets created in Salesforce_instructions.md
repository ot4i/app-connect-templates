To refer to these instructions while editing the flow, open [the github page](https://github.com/ot4i/app-connect-templates/tree/master/resources/markdown//Invoke%20a%20function%20from%20AWS%20Lambda%20whenever%20an%20opportunity%20gets%20created%20in%20Salesforce_instructions.md) (opens in a new window).

1. Click **Create flow** to start using the template.
2. Connect to the following accounts by using your credentials:
   - **Salesforce**
   - **AWS Lambda** 
   - **Gmail**
3. To start the flow, in the banner click **Start flow**.

The flow is started when an opportunity gets created in Salesforce.

In this example, the flow will create and populate the Salesforce opportunities table on a webpage that contains the opportunities and revenue details and share the information via Gmail with all the relevant stakeholders.
