Use this template to make a voice call to the component owner using Twilio when a new ticket with an urgent priority is created in Zendesk Service. If the priority is urgent, a Twilio voice call is made to the saved component owner, whose information was retrieved from a saved Microsoft Excel Online worksheet based on the component details. A Slack message is posted on the intended channel, detailing the worksheet row's information.
