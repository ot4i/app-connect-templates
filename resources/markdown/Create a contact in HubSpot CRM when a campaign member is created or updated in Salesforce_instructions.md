Use this template to create a contact in HubSpot CRM whenever a campaign member is created or updated in Salesforce. In this example, for each Salesforce contact that has a unique email address, the contact is created in HubSpot CRM. Otherwise, a Gmail message gets sent to indicate that the contact already exists.
