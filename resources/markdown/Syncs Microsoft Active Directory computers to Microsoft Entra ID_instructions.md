This flow is a scheduler-based flow that retrieves computers from Microsoft Active Directory (AD) through a batch process.

The flow creates or updates the device in Microsoft Entra ID whenever a new computer is created or updated in Microsoft AD, helping you keep your devices information in sync.

For more information, visit the IBM Integration Community for this use case. See, [Using Microsoft Entra ID with IBMÂ® App Connect](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/integration/blogs/shamini-arumugam1/2022/04/01/using-ibm-app-connect-to-interact-with-msazure-ad).
