Use this template to associate a newly created prospect to a list in Salesforce Account Engagement from a MailChimp list whenever a new subscriber is created in MailChimp.Â If the list exists, based on the new subscriber, a prospect is created, and the prospect is then associated with the existing list. If the list does not exist, a list is created along with the prospect details, and it will be associated with the newly created list in Salesforce Account Engagement.
