To refer to these instructions while editing the flow, open [the github page](https://github.com/ot4i/app-connect-templates/blob/master/resources/markdown/API%20to%20create%20leads%20in%20Salesforce%20using%20a%20csv%20file%20from%20Box_instructions.md) (opens in a new window).

This API takes a URL to a CSV file in Box, and an optional event name. It uses that information to retrieve the file's contents (CSV data), parse that CSV data, and create a new lead in Salesforce for every line that matches the event name given when calling the API. If you didn't give an event name, leads for all the lines from the CSV are created or updated in Salesforce.  The email address is used to determine if the lead already exists in Salesforce or not. The flow does not change the original file.

Before you use this flow, you must have a CSV file in Box with the following items in the header row, in this order:
* **First Name** 
* **Last Name**
* **Email Address** (This will be used to work out if this user already exists in Salesforce, or not.)
* **Company**
* **Event** (When you call the API, this is the column that will be used to check if the event name matches the one you've specified.)

The first line in your CSV file should look like this:
`First Name,Last Name,Email,Company,Event`
