The flow is triggered whenever a new contact is created in Salesforce.  The action then taken depends on the new contact's Mailing Country (MailingCountry):
- If the new contact's MailingCountry is either USA or India, a contact’s data extension values table in Salesforce Marketing Cloud is created with the contact’s details.
- Otherwise, a Slack message is sent that a table with the contact's MailingCountry does not exist.
