3.	To start the flow, in the banner, open the options menu [⋮] and click **Start flow**.

Use this template for the following scenario: 
<br>An email gets sent from your Gmail account to the subscribers of the platform event. The Salesforce custom platform event in this example is either the COVID vaccination in Pune or Mumbai.
This is a sequel scenario to the use case "Create a platform event in Salesforce whenever a product is created or updated in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales."

**Tips**: You can update or select the platform event based on the COVID vaccination location.
