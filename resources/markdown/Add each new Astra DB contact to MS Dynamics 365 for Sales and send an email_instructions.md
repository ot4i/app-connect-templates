In this example, the flow triggers when a new contact is added in MS Dynamics 365 for Sales. This flow will add the same contact to Astra DB, and once the contact is added successfully, a notification email will be sent with the contact details. It helps you keep contact records in sync between MS Dynamics 365 for Sales and Astra DB.
