Use this template to create a file in Box based on the value retrieved from each new row in a Google Sheets worksheet. In this example, if the value retrieved from the worksheet contains 'http', an HTTP method is invoked with a URL request to run the URL, which is retrieved from the worksheet's current item value. This request retrieves the content, and a file is created with the obtained content in Box.
