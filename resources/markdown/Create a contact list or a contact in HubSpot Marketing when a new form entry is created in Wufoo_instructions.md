Use this template to create a contact list or a contact in HubSpot Marketing when a new form entry is created in Wufoo. 

In this example, consider that an event is being organized only for women. When a new Wufoo form entry is created, HubSpot Marketing retrieves its contact list.Â A contact list will be created based on the company details provided in the form. If the company doesn't exist in HubSpot Marketing, a new contact list is created. If the company already exists, a contact is directly created in HubSpot Marketing. 

A contact is created in HubSpot Marketing only if the contact is female. Otherwise, a Gmail message gets sent to the recipient, notifying them that the event is only for women.
