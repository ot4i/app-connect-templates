    Whenever a Salesforce opportunity update fails because of incorrect values, an email with the error details gets sent to the intended recipient.
    In this flow, the opportunity gets updated with the wrong campaign ID. Hence, the updated opportunity fails, and an email gets sent to the intended recipient from your email account.
