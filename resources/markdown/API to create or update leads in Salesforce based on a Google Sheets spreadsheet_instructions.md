To refer to these instructions while editing the flow, open [the github page](https://github.com/ot4i/app-connect-templates/blob/master/resources/markdown/API%20to%20create%20or%20update%20leads%20in%20Salesforce%20based%20on%20data%20collected%20in%20a%20Google%20Sheets%20spreadsheet_instructions.md) (opens in a new window).

This API takes an event name and uses that name to compare against data in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. Any leads found in the spreadsheet for the event name specified in the call will be either added to, or updated in Salesforce depending on whether or not a lead with the same email address already exists in Salesforce. The flow does not change the original spreadsheet.

Before you use this flow, you must have a Google Sheets spreadsheet with the following columns, in this order:
* **First Name** 
* **Last Name**
* **Email Address** (This will be used to work out if this user already exists in Salesforce, or not.)
* **Company**
* **Event** (When you call the API, this is the column that will be used to check if the event name matches the one you've specified.)

Any other columns after the first five specified here will be ignored by this flow.
