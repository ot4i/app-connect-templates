Use this template to create a new task in a list in Microsoft To Do whenever a new row is appended in Microsoft Excel Online. A new list is created if the list doesn’t exist in To Do based on the information retrieved from the Microsoft Excel Online worksheet. A task is then added to the newly created list. Otherwise, if the list already exists in To Do, the task will be added to that list.
