Use this template to add subscribers to a list in Mailchimp when new rows are appended to a Microsoft Excel Online spreadsheet. In this example, when a new row is appended in a Microsoft Excel Online spreadsheet, for each Mailchimp member whose status code equals 200, a Slack notification is posted in a channel to notify them that the member already exists. Otherwise, the member is added as a subsciber to a list in MaliChimp.
