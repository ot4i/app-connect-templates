In this example, the flow triggers when new contact is added in AstraDb and this flow will add same contact to MsDynamicCrmRest and once contact is added sucessfully as a notification mail will be sent with contact details. It helps you keep the contacts records in sync from AstraDb to MsDynamicsCrmRest.
