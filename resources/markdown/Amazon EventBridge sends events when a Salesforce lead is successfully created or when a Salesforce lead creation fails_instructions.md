Use this template to perform the following use case: When a new row is appended to the Microsoft Excel Online worksheet, a lead is created in Salesforce.
Upon each successful lead creation in Salesforce, Amazon EventBridge sends events to the specified event bus. 
A Slack notification then confirms that the event has been published. 

If the Salesforce lead creation fails, Amazon EventBridge sends events to the specified event bus, and a Slack notification gets sent to the intended channel informing that the failed event is published.
