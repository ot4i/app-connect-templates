To refer to these instructions while editing the flow, open [the github page](https://github.com/ot4i/app-connect-templates/tree/master/resources/markdown/Stop%20or%20start%20or%20reboot%20the%20Amazon%20RDS%20instance%20whenever%20a%20Zendesk%20Service%20ticket%20gets%20created_instructions.md) (opens in a new window).

1. Click **Create flow** to start using the template.
2. Connect to the following accounts by using your credentials:
   - **Zendesk Services** 
   - **Amazon RDS**
3. To start the flow, in the banner, open the options menu [⋮] and click **Start flow**.

The flow is started whenever a new ticket gets created in Zendesk Service.

In this example, the flow checks the Zendesk Service ticket’s subject to whether to start, stop, or reboot the Amazon RDS instance based on the instance ID from the Zendesk Service ticket.
