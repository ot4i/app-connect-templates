To refer to these instructions while editing the flow, open [the github page](https://github.com/ot4i/app-connect-templates/blob/master/resources/markdown/Welcome%20guide%20flow%20to%20announce%20new%20Eventbrite%20attendee%20on%20Slack_instructions.md) (opens in a new window).

This template creates the flow from the [Welcome guide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-65X2RZuE&list=PLzpeuWUENMK2Q77xr7QkvLxU5YxOJxVSH&index=4&t=0s) of how to send a Slack message when new attendees register for the Sunflower festival Eventbrite event.

## Prerequisites

To use this flow, you'll need to set up an event in Eventbrite. The event needs to be configured to collect the following information about new attendees:
* First name
* Last name
* Company

In the video of this flow, the event also collects information about the attendee's email address, phone number and how they are getting to the event. That information is not essential for this template. It is used in a follow on flow, and instructions on setting up that extra information are included in the follow on template instructions.
