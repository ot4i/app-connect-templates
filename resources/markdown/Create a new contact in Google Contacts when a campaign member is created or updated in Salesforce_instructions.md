Use this template to create a contact in Google Contacts whenever a new campaign member is either created or updated in Salesforce. In this example, whenever a campaign member is created or updated in Salesforce, if the contact is new, then it gets created in Google Contacts. Otherwise, a Gmail message is sent to notify them that the contact already exists.
