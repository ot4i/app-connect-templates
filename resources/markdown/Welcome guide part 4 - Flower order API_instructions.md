This template creates the flow from the [Welcome to IBM App Connect [Part 4 of 4]: Create flows for an API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgYAIl5lXt4&list=PL_4RxtD-BL5tKxx9GiR2BH146ZUC21cOp) video, which creates an API to update flower orders in Salesforce, and add new orders to a Trello board.

## Prerequisites

To use this flow, you'll need:
* A Trello board and list to which you can post your flower orders.
* An order with order products in Salesforce.

To setup the order in Salesforce, you'll need to create:
* Flower products with: Name, Product code, Product family (Seeds or Bulb), Active status set to 'true'.
* A price book. Once this is created, enter all your products into the active price book.
* An order, with order products for each flower product you have. To create the order you'll need to create an account and a  contract.

You can use the following templates to help with this setup in Salesforce:
* Welcome guide setup 1 - Add products to Salesforce.
* Welcome guide setup 2 - Create Sunflower Festival order in Salesforce.
