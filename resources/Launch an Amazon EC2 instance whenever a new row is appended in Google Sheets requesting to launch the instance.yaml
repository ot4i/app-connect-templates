  name: Launch an Amazon EC2 instance whenever a new row is appended in Google Sheets requesting to launch the instance
  description: >-
    Use this template to launch an Amazon EC2 instance whenever a new row is appended in the Google Sheets worksheet. In this example, the worksheet has AMI (Availability Machine Images) related parameters. It checks for the column value that indicates whether to launch the instance. An email is then sent from your Gmail account to the intended recipient to notify them that the instance has been launched.
