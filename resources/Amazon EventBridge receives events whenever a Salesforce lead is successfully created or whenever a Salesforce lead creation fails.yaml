  name: Amazon EventBridge receives events whenever a Salesforce lead is successfully created or whenever a Salesforce lead creation fails
  description: >-
    Use this template to perform the following use case: When the event is received from the specified custom event bus, it checks whether a lead has been successfully created in Salesforce. If a lead is successfully created in Salesforce, a Slack notification gets sent to the relevant squad. Likewise, if a lead is not created in Salesforce, a Slack notification gets sent to the relevant squad.
